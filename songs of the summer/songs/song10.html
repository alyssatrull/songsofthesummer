            <h2>Review</h2>
            <p>"Birds Of A Feather" has such a unique sound to it. With its hypnotic sound and beat, it's difficult to not lay back and jam to this song. Her vocals really bring everything together and add a sweet tone to the song. The lyrics are also so thoughtful and catchy that it's addictive to sing along with Billie.</p>
