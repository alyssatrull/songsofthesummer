            <h2>Review</h2>
            <p>Benson Boone's vocals, being so rich and powerful, are otherworldly and set him apart from any other artist in my opinion. This song is just one of the many masterpieces Boone has created. The melody and buildup to the chorus are so clever and make this one incredible.</p>
